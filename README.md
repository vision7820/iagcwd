# Improved Adaptive Gamma Correction
This is an python implementation of the paper "Contrast enhancement of brightness-distorted images by improved adaptive gamma correction." at https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04427. The purpose of the algorithm is to improve the contrast of the image adaptively.

## System Environment
- Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS
- Python >= 3.6
- Opencv >= 3.4.1
- Numpy >= 1.14.4
